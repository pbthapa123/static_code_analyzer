## Local Execution:

1.  To run the project locally, follow these steps: 

      git clone https://github.com/pbthapa123/static_code_analyzer.git

2.  Navigate into the project directory:

      cd static_code_analyzer

3.  Install any necessary dependencies (if applicable).

    Some dependencies are:

     - Python 3.8 or newer (works best up to 3.12)

     - tkinter (built-in with Python)

     - No third-party libraries needed for the basic version

     - pip install -r requirements.txt

4.  Run the application 
    
        python gui.py

5.  *Can refer to READMWE.md file for the local execution.*
     - The README.md includes clear, step-by-step setup instructions for installing dependencies 
       and running the application locally. 

     - With these guidelines, the setup will be smooth. The program operates as intended, 
       with no setup difficulties or defects, indicating a consistent and 
       replicable local environment.


## Application Features 

   **The following features are included in the application:**
  
   - Python file static code analysis.

   - Identifying code smells like inefficient loops, large memory allocations, blocking I/O, and 
     more.

   - Analyzing and emphasizing possible issues in the code.

   - The analyzer can be accessed through a basic command-line interface.
   
   - A structured code that is modular, allowing for easy maintenance and extension.
