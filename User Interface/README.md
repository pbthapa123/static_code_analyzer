# Static Code Analyzer

## Description  
The **Static Code Analyzer** is a Python-based tool designed to analyze source code and detect code smells, inefficiencies, and potential issues.  
It helps developers improve code quality by providing structured insights based on predefined analysis rules.

## Primary Functioanlities of the codes. 
- gui.py handles the GUI window and provides a way for the user to upload Python files.
- static_analyzer.py performs analysis on the uploaded Python file, looking for issues like inefficient memory     usage or blocking operations.
- These codes work together.gui.py uses StaticAnalyzer to analyze the code from a file, and then it displays the results in a text area.

## Purpose & Value  
- Ensures high-quality code by detecting code smells.  
- Helps developers maintain clean, efficient, and readable code.  
- Assists in AI-assisted code review by integrating machine learning for better insights.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python** (Core Programming)  
- **Tkinter** (GUI for user-friendly interaction)  
- **Machine Learning** (For advanced code smell detection)
